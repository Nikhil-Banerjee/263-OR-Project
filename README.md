# ENGSCI 263  - Woolworths Operations Research Project

## Project Overview
For this project, our aim was to develop a computer model to analyse the impact of a store closure
on the costs of operation of Woolworths pallet delivery system.

## Main Files
***GroupingFunctions.py***
  * The file consists of code used to group the stores by location as a precursor to the route generation.

***routeFuncsNikhil.py***
  * This file consists of our route generate code.

***main.py***
  * This file runs the LP model implementation for cost optimisation

***Simulation.py***
  * This file includes code for simulating cost distributions

***().pkl***
  * These files are used to store delivery route information.

***route_visuals.py***
  * This file generates interactive maps that show our optimal routes.

***weekdayRoutes.html & saturdayRoutes.html***
  * These file are the interactive maps that show our optimal routes.

***WoolworthsDemand.csv, WoolworthsLocations.csv, WoolworthsDistances.csv & WoolworthsTravelDurations.csv***
  * These files were the data sets provided by Woolworths
